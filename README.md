- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jovanako
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development. I find coding incredibly fun and interesting because I am constantly challenged. What I like the most at this point of my learning journey is the moment I run my code and see what a couple of lines of code have actually created on a web page. It's like magic to me.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript.
